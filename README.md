# "Build a Public holidays app" for the "React Practice Calendar" challenge by reactpractice.dev 

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

- Started the calendar daily challenges on a boring Saturday evening after a brutal rain ruined my plans for the night
- Made it in plain and simple React, as requested in the challenge
- Styles are simple, akin to what the exercise asks to do, but it could benefit for further development (although this doesn't test CSS skills)

**NOTE:** .env file is not in the .gitignore as the variables are public and this doesn't need security.
